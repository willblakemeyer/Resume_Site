						<h2>Physics Game with Machine Learning</h2>
						<p>Description: This project simulates an environment based on a popular online game called bonk.io and it trains neural networks to play the game automatically. The neural networks and their structure were generated with TensorFlow.js, which allowed me to get some experience with this powerful machine learning library. I also implemented the feature to play against the AI in a testing mode. As of writing this, I do plan to implement this AI into the online game itself and have it play against other people.</p>

						<!-- <h2>Sumo</h2>
						<p>Description: This was about the first notable project I've made, where I created a two-player physics game. The goal of the game is simple: knock your opponent out of the ring to win (just like in Sumo wrestling). To make the game more interesting, I gave both players unique abilities, where the larger player is able to boost himself by holding the spacebar, and the smaller player is able to make a clone of himself by pressing the forward slash key.</p>

						<h2>Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm</h2>
						<p>Description: To better my understanding of neural networks, I built my own from scratch. I wrote this in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with no libraries; I only used another person's code for a simple sorting algorithm. The end result was a semi-functional, learning, group of AIs that attempted to follow around a little character I created. There were customizable settings like the mutation rate, population, the number of successors for the next generation, etc. I had to guide them by the hand a bit in the learning process, but ultimately the project was successful and my understanding of neural networks improved.</p>

						<h2>Chess Recreation</h2>
						<p>Description: This program is essentially a computer chess game built from scratch. It draws a position, allows the player to only make legal moves, and puts the player up against a chess AI. The program understands all the rules of chess, including castling and en passant. Unfortunately, the AI is very simple, as it will just make random moves unless it can capture something. Originally I was going to implement a better chess AI, but I decided to do this as a separate project.</p>

						<h2>Simple Chess Engine</h2>
						<p>Description: Communicates with Lichess, an online chess website, to run a chess bot against other opponents. This chess engine utilizes tailuge's bot-o-tron library, which can be found at <a href="github.com/tailuge/bot-o-tron">github.com/tailuge/bot-o-tron</a>.</p>

						<h2>Bonk.io Bot</h2>
						<p>Description: This bot controls my keyboard inputs and grabs pixels from the screen to play an online game. Instead of relying on a more familiar language like JavaScript, I decided to learn Java for this project. Hardly ever even touching the Java language, I knew this wouldn't be easy. With ample effort and googling, I was able to put together a functional bot that plays about as good as a new player. The code is horrendous, but relatively not bad considering I practically never used Java before.</p>

						<h2>Animation Maker</h2>
						<p>Description: This tool allows someone to create animations from a chrome tab and then replay them. It allows the user to customize the brush size, colors (including the alpha channel), and frame rate.  </p>
